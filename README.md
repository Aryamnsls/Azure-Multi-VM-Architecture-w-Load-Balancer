# Azure-Multi-VM-Architecture-w-Load-Balancer
Azure Multi-VM Architecture w/ Load Balancer

Project Summary
Designed and deployed a scalable, highly available web architecture using Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across both Windows and Linux virtual machines, each serving distinct web content. Demonstrated real-world skills in infrastructure provisioning, load balancing, network security, port mapping, and cross-platform server configuration.

üß± Key Features & Implementation Steps
1.	Infrastructure Setup
o	Created a Windows VM with IIS Web Server hosting a custom HTML page.
o	Created a Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04) with Apache2 serving a different HTML page.
o	Both VMs were deployed under the same Virtual Network and Subnet.
2.	Web Server Configuration
o	Configured Windows VM to serve content using IIS via port 80.
o	Configured Linux VM to serve content using Apache2 via port 80.
o	Added personalized HTML content to verify source machine when accessed.
3.	Load Balancer Setup
o	Created an Azure Public Load Balancer to handle traffic on port 80.
o	Configured a Backend Pool and added both VM NICs.
o	Created a Health Probe to monitor HTTP (TCP 80) response.
o	Created a Load Balancing Rule to forward frontend traffic to backend VMs.
4.	Security & Connectivity
o	Configured NSG rules to allow HTTP (port 80) traffic.
o	Managed firewall rules in both Windows (via PowerShell) and Linux (via ufw).
o	Ensured connectivity using Test-NetConnection, curl, and browser tests.
5.	Testing & Validation
o	Accessed the Load Balancer IP through a browser.
o	Verified that requests were routed to either the Windows or Linux VM randomly.
o	Ensured high availability and distribution using refresh cycles.
